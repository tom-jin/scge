Description: A package to simulate realistic gene expression data, initially for
  single cell genomics but generalisable to other sources of gene expression
  data. Models are fitted to reproduce the mean expression, mean-variance,
  mean-censorship and correlation relationships within the data. Parameters from
  an example fit are provided should data be unavailable.
